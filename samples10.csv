0,18.0,The code use meaningful identifier names and are organized in a way that makes the logical flow of operations somewhat easy to follow. ,Readability,15,1,B+
0,18.0,"The core requirements like having 5+ species with predators, prey, plants, gender, and day/night behavior seem met based on the code. The challenge mission was completed well.",Correctness,15,1,A-
0,18.0,"The code is broken out into many separate classes for each species and simulation component, enabling decent modularity and reuse. The logic could likely be simplified in places, but overall the design and efficiency are reasonable without overly sacrificing readability.",Code Elegance,15,1,A-
0,18.0,"The code is exceptionally well documented. Each class and method has clear, detailed comments describing its purpose and parameters. In-line comments explain complex logic. Files contain header comments.",Documentation,15,1,A
0,18.0,Generally good identifier names and nice indentation for segregating methods.,Readability,16,1,A
0,18.0,"Gender was not implemented for the animals, The majority of base tasks have been completed.",Correctness,16,1,C+
0,18.0,"Most methods in animal classes are repeatedly defined, so perhaps some sort of inheritance can be included in. the predator and prey classes to increase reusability.",Code Elegance,16,1,C+
0,18.0,"Generally good comments to explain what the code is trying to do, although some confusion caused by some comments.",Documentation,16,1,A
0,18.0,The variables are defined well and the codes are easy to understand.,Readability,13,1,A++
0,18.0,"The code finishes the base task and add weather as the challenge task. However, after running the simulation for 650 steps, it is counter-intuitive that it only left Porcupine and all other animals are all dead.",Correctness,13,1,A-
0,18.0,The code have a good use of classed and functions and nicely laid out.,Code Elegance,13,1,A++
0,18.0,The documentation is well written and organised,Documentation,13,1,A++
